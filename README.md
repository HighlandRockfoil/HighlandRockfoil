<h2>School</h2>
I am currently a junior at Westchester Academy for International Studies, and a student in the IB Programme. I am interested in Aerospace Engineering, and so I am taking classes like IB Analysis HL, IB Physics HL, and IB Computer Science SL. I am also very involved in my school's extracirriculars, as i am a part of:
- Mu Alpha Theta
- Science National Honour Society
- National Honour Society
- Westchester Student Counsil
- The Ultimate Frisbee Club
...and I am an officer in:
- Computer Science National Honour Society
- The Westchester Robotics Team
<h2>Not School</h2>
Outside of school I enjoy reading, cartography, and worldbuilding alongside other more scientific projects. Cartography is my main and most unique passion however, as the art of mapmaking is oftentimes forgotten. Nevertheless, I have been drawing maps for over nine years now, and have accumulated over a hundred maps of the world I am creating.
